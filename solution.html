                                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Climate change is happening now, and it’s the most serious threat to life on our planet. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Fortunately, there are plenty of solutions to climate change, they are well-understood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px; ">In 2015, world leaders signed a major treaty called </span><a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/what-is-paris-climate-agreement-and-why-does-it-matter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">the Paris agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to put these solutions into practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Core to all climate change solutions is reducing <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/climate-change/what-causes-climate-change/">greenhouse gas emissions</a>, which must get to zero as soon as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Because both forests and oceans play vitally important roles in regulating our climate, increasing the natural ability of forests and oceans to absorb carbon dioxide can also help stop global warming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">The main ways to stop climate change are to pressure government and business to:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<<li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Keep fossil fuels in the ground.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;"> Fossil fuels include coal, oil and gas – and the more that are extracted and burned, the worse climate change will get. All countries need to move their economies away from fossil fuels as soon as possible.</span></li>
<li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Invest in renewable energy.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;"> Changing our main energy sources to clean and renewable energy is the best way to stop using fossil fuels. These include technologies like solar, wind, wave, tidal and geothermal power.</span></li>
<li style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Switch to sustainable transport.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Petrol and diesel vehicles, planes and ships use fossil fuels. Reducing car use, switching to electric vehicles and minimising plane travel will not only help stop climate change, it will reduce air pollution too.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b style="font-size:25px;">Help us keep our homes cosy </b><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Homes shouldn’t be draughty and cold – it’s a waste of money, and miserable in the winter. The government can help households heat our homes in a green way – such as by insulating walls and roofs and switching away from oil or gas boilers to heat pumps.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b style="font-size:25px;"><b><strong>Improve farming and encourage vegan diets.</strong></b> One of the best ways for individuals to help stop climate change is by reducing their meat and dairy consumption, or by going fully vegan. Businesses and food retailers can improve farming practices and provide more plant-based products to help people make the shift.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b style="font-size:25px;">Restore nature to absorb more carbon. <span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">T</span></b><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">he natural world is very good at cleaning up our emissions, but we need to look after it. Planting trees in the right places or giving land back to nature through ‘rewilding’ schemes is a good place to start. This is because photosynthesising plants draw down carbon dioxide as they grow, locking it away in soils. </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b style="font-size:25px;">Protect forests like the Amazon.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;"> Forests are crucial in the fight against climate change, and protecting them is an important climate solution. Cutting down forests on an industrial scale destroys giant trees which could be sucking up huge amounts of carbon. Yet companies destroy forests to make way for animal farming, soya or palm oil plantations. Governments can stop them by making better laws.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b style="font-size:25px;">Protect the oceans.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;"> Oceans also absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps to keep our climate stable. But many are overfished, used for oil and gas drilling or threatened by deep sea mining. Protecting oceans and the life in them is ultimately a way to protect ourselves from climate change.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b style="font-size:25px;">Reduce how much people consume.</b> Our tr<span style="font-weight: 400font-size:25px;;">ansport, fashion, food and other lifestyle choices all have different impacts on the climate. This is often by design – fashion and technology companies, for example, will release far more products than are realistically needed. But while reducing consumption of these products might be hard, it’s most certainly worth it. Reducing overall consumption in more wealthy countries can help put less strain on the planet.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b style="font-size:25px;">Reduce plastic. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Plastic is made from oil, and the process of extracting, refining and turning oil into plastic (or even polyester, for clothing) is </span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190415144004.htm#:~:text=Plastics%20have%20surprisingly%20carbon%2Dintense%20life%20cycles.&amp;text=Dumping%2C%20incinerating%2C%20recycling%20and%20composting,billion%20metric%20tons%20of%20CO2."><span style="font-weight: 400;">surprisingly carbon-intense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It doesn’t break down quickly in nature so a lot of plastic is burned, which contributes to emissions. Demand for plastic is rising so quickly that creating and disposing of plastics will account for </span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190415144004.htm#:~:text=Plastics%20have%20surprisingly%20carbon%2Dintense%20life%20cycles.&amp;text=Dumping%2C%20incinerating%2C%20recycling%20and%20composting,billion%20metric%20tons%20of%20CO2."><span style="font-weight: 400;">17% of the global carbon budget by 2050</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (this is the emissions count we need to stay within according to the Paris agreement).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, and to feel that climate change is too big to solve. But we already have the answers, now it’s a question of making them happen. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To work, all of these solutions need strong international cooperation between governments and businesses, including the most polluting sectors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Individuals can also play a part by making better choices about where they get their energy, how they travel, and what food they eat. But the best way for anyone to help stop climate change is to take collective action. This means pressuring governments and corporations to change their policies and business practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments want to be re-elected. And businesses can’t survive without customers. Demanding action from them is a powerful way to make change happen.</span></p>
<h2>The fossil fuel industry is blocking climate change action</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Major oil and gas companies including BP, Exxon and Shell have spent hundreds of millions of pounds trying to delay or stop government policies that would have helped tackle the climate crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Despite the effects of climate change becoming more and more obvious, big polluting corporations – the ones responsible for the majority of carbon emissions – continue to carry on drilling for and burning fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Industries including banks, car and energy companies also make profits from fossil fuels. These industries are knowingly putting money over the future of our planet and the safety of its people.</span></p>
<h2>What are world leaders doing to stop climate change?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">With such a huge crisis facing the entire planet, the international response should be swift and decisive. Yet progress by world governments has been achingly slow. Many commitments to reduce carbon emissions have been set, but few are binding and targets are often missed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">In Paris in 2015, world leaders from 197 countries pledged to put people first and reduce their countries’ greenhouse gas emissions. <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/what-is-paris-climate-agreement-and-why-does-it-matter/">The Paris agreement</a> has the aim of limiting global warming to well below 2ºC and ideally to 1.5°C. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">If governments act swiftly on the promises they made in the Paris climate agreement, and implement the solutions now, there’s </span><a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/are-world-leaders-on-track-to-sort-out-the-climate-and-nature-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still hope of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Global climate change activism</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Around the world, millions of us are taking steps to defend our climate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Tens of thousands of school strikers and people from all walks of life have taken to the streets demanding a solution to the climate emergency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Over the years, Greenpeace has challenged oil companies chasing new fossil fuels to extract and burn. We’ve also called out the UK government for their failure to act fast enough on the climate emergency. Meanwhile, ordinary people have blocked tankers and fracking rigs, letting everyone know that renewable energy is the answer to fossil fuels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;"><a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/forests/indigenous-peoples/">Indigenous Peoples</a> are most severely affected by both the causes and effects of climate change. They are often on the front lines, facing down <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/winging-it-uks-chicken-boom-is-fuelling-deforestation-in-south-america/">deforestation</a> or kicking out fossil fuel industries that want to put their water supplies at risk from oil spills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">Communities in the Pacific Islands are facing sea level rises and more extreme weather. But they are using their strength and resilience to demand world leaders take quicker climate action in global meetings, such as COP21 in Paris 2015. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size:25px;">For many of these communities, climate change is a fight for life itself. And for many countries around the world, including the UK, climate change is having more and more of a negative impact on people. As a country with the wealth and power to really tackle climate change, it’s never been more important to demand that our leaders act.</span></p>
